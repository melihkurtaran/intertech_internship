The project I've done by using C# and the latest version(4.0) of Selenium 

First of all, it navigates to n11.com and search for Iphone 8 plus

When it searched, several options appears. The program hovers the mouse over items

It selects one of them and try to buy it without log-in

It enters an e-mail and then fills the all form which is needed to continue.

It selects dropdown inputs and enter the texts and submit.

When it submit the form, it asks for payment information and the program terminates.
